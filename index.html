<h2 class="section-heading">Problem</h2>
<p>Through a human-centered design process, we found three main problems in current VR technology: 

<ol>
	<li>Immersion is limited. Currently, the focus in VR is on expanding visual capabilities, with little attention on other sensory capabilities. </li>
	<li>Control is unintuitive. Interactions with VR objects require button presses in addition to movement, with controllers that need to be held constantly. Furthermore, you often cannot even see your hands. </li>
	<li>Movements in VR are unnatural. Observing VR users showed robotic start-and-stop motions. We believe this is driven by the unnatural controller scheme as the manipulation method. </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p> Haptic feedback can solve these issues by intuitively providing more information to the user, allowing them to explore virtual worlds with a new level of immersion.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Context</h2>
<p>Currently, many AR/VR head-mounted devices (HMDs) utilize controllers that resemble untethered joysticks with button panels. These require a constant holding force in the hand, and interacting with an object in the virtual world requires not only movement but button presses. After conducting observations of VR users, we concluded that motions in VR are unnatural and robotic, and hypothesize that this is due to the unnatural controller scheme. While using existing controllers may become more intuitive with practice, we aim to create a virtual experience that is immediately as natural and immersive as possible.</p>
<p>Most of the work in virtual reality has been focused on pushing the boundaries of the visual capabilities of HMDs, with some work also on auditory complements. Many haptic devices are in development or being researched, but are unavailable for market. Those that are on the market, such as Oculus Touch, still rely on the user to hold a controller.</p>
<p>Our project, Tacto, is focused on creating a haptic glove to give VR users feedback from virtual objects, essentially letting them feel said virtual objects. We are studying the capabilities of haptic actuators to develop artificial perceptions of texture and generating a human-computer interaction “haptic language.” This language and its development will primarily allow users to immediately understand when they are touching a virtual object or surface, or that a significant event in the virtual world has transpired. We predict that this technology has the potential to revolutionize the way people interact with virtual environments.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Audience</h2>
<p>While the capabilities of VR are as of yet untested, the market potential is high. Any VR application from gaming to telepresence to professional training and anywhere in between would be augmented by the addition of haptic feedback. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Research</h2>
<p>In our project we used a process known as design thinking, which is entirely human-centered. We performed over 20 interviews and observations, gathering insights into how virtual reality users could benefit by using a flexible and stretchable wearable. The interviews ranged anywhere from virtual reality hardware designers to enthusiasts, coupled with observations we did at industry panels and events, such as UC Berkeley’s Virtual Reality event VXPC (https://vxpc.io/), UC Berkeley’s Inudstry and Research Panel in Virtual Reality, meetings with members and panelists of the Berkeley VR Club, and the AR/VR Pitch Competition at Berkeley with SkyDeck. Our goal was to discover the latent needs present in the VR experience.
Our main needs discovered are listed below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Easily bringing objects from the real space into the virtual space</li>
  <li>Use of augmented reality to improve safety mechanisms in daily life</li>
  <li>Lack of motion control in Augmented Reality</li>
  <li>Augmentation of safety through haptics</li>
  <li>Aid of handicapped people with AR/VR</li>
  <li>Leveraging augmented reality for instructional purposes in real activities</li>
  <li>Preventing motion sickness when using VR headsets</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">Concepts and Prototyping</h2>
<p>From these needs, we did brainstorming sessions individually and as a group to come up with conceptual solutions to address these unexplored user needs. Separately, we ended up coming with a total of 53 concepts that then transformed into 75 concepts when we brainstormed as a group by using methods of idea recombination and reframing. To better visualize, categorize, and select the concepts we did a method known as ‘clustering’.  In this process we took all concepts that addressed similar needs and grouped them together. The concepts that did not align with our core needs we started counting out, leaving us with 27 concepts for the final selection stage. 
The next step was to narrow down our 27 concepts into a smaller number which we could move forward with. We brainstormed our judgement criteria by considering the needs of our top stakeholders: users, Samsung, Stanford Collaboration Researchers, our advisors, and our capstone team. For these groups, we decided on the criteria listed on the right of the chart below.</p>
<p>Each concept was rated against these criteria, and the top 3 concepts were chosen as a first selection stage to get feedback from our sponsor Samsung and from virtual reality experts. After receiving feedback from our sponsor and industry experts, we concluded that the most powerful ideas with our technology would be a hand wearable to provide haptic feedback in virtual reality, and a flexible sensing cloth to bring in real objects into the virtual world. However, the latter option has the disadvantage that the market is already saturated of much more advanced methods for capturing real geometry efficiently and bringing it into virtual reality. After compiling these insights, we finally decided to pursue a glove form factor that could bring tangible feelings into the virtual reality environment through haptic feedback, which we call Tacto.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What is Tacto?</h2>

<p> Tacto is a haptic glove for Virtual Reality, developed as a Berkeley Master of Engineering Capstone project sponsored by Samsung. The original premise of the project was to enhance the Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) experiences in some way while leveraging flexible, stretchable electronics being developed for Samsung. </p>

<p> The first semester of this project was focused on design research, using the Human-Centered Design Method. We interviewed and observed users of VR/AR devices to find unmet needs and white spaces, coming up with a few core insights. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Immersion in VR is limited</li>
  <p> Currently, the focus in VR is on expanding visual capabilities, with little attention on other sensory capabilities. </p>
  <li>Control is unintuitive</li>
  <p> Interactions with VR objects require button presses in addition to movement, with controllers that need to be held constantly. Furthermore, you often cannot even see your hands.</p>
  <li>Movements in VR are unnatural.</li>
  <p>Observing VR users showed robotic start-and-stop motions. We believe this is driven by the unnatural controller scheme as the manipulation method. </p>
</ul>

<p> The VR experience is limited by its unintuitive control and ineffectiveness in targeting senses besides sight (and sometimes sound). Haptic feedback can solve these issues by intuitively providing more information to the user, allowing them to explore virtual worlds with a new level of immersion. </p>

<p> Tacto, a haptic feedback controller in the form of a glove, will address these problems. By adding custom haptic cues for various interactions in the VR environment, what we call a new “haptic language,” we envision an expansion of the capabilities of VR to provide information to the user in a natural way. This haptic language is my main focus. Using a glove form factor eliminates the need to hold a controller, allowing for users to interact with objects in VR the same way they would normally.</p>

<p> This semester has been focused on prototyping, with imaeembegs of our first generation prototype shown below. </p>
